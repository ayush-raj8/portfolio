Tickets contain a QR code that can be verified by creator listing the event.\n\nIntegrated Firebase authentication and RBAC authorization to differentiate between creators and regular users. Gained experience in scheduling tasks in Django to keep the Redis cache up to date. Utilized JWT for request authentication at the Django backend via custom middleware."
